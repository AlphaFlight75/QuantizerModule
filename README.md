# QuantizerModule
Code and hardware for Kosmo/Eurorack quantizer module

This is a quantizer based on the [dacarduino](https://github.com/holmesrichards/dacarduino) board. As such it uses the dacarduino library as well as the Quantizer library in this repository.

Design is for Kosmo format module but the PCB and code would work equally well for a Eurorack version. It would just need a smaller front panel.
